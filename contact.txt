    Class that generates new instances of contacts (This is a docstring)
    Docstrings are strings that occur as the first statement of a named block
    They allow us to document what the code block does


    #__init__ method helps us define properties for our objects
    '''
    first_name: New contact first name.
    last_name : New contact last name.
    phone_number: New contact phone number.
        email : New contact email address.
    '''

    Instance Variables: Variables that are unique to each new instance of the class
    ie first_name, last_name, phone_number and email.

    Class Variables: Variables that belong to the entire class and can be accessed by all instances of the class

    Test Class: Class that defines test cases for the contact class behaviours.
    unittest.TestCase: TestCase class that helps in creating test cases

    Subclass: Normal class but in addition to its own variables and method it also inherits
    methods and variables from another class.

    setUp() method allows us to define instructionsthat will be executed before each test method
